# Past
#### In the past, medical professions we not as safe as they are today for several reasons. One of the reasons was that humans were less technologically advanced than they are today.


#### Medical practice wasn't efficient
* People did not have secure and open access to real doctors due to it's expense problem
    * Since people didn't have the access to the professionals, they had to rely on people who didn't know what they were doing

 * Equipment was not advanced and was usually a combination of forceps, knives, scalpels, saws, lancets, needles, which are not efficient. A picture of those tools can be found above.
    * Doctors would usually reuse the same tools with different patients which isn't very sanitary leading to a spread of disease




#### Medical practice was expensive

* The education/training that doctors need to go through may make the medical field the hardest and most competitve career that existed. This created a scarcity

    * This created demand on doctors which limited the ability for lower classess of population to be able to afford this basic necessity
