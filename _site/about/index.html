        The year-long project started with us picking a favorite topic (non-tech related) that we would be passionate to research about all year. I chose Medical Practice, and I would say I'm still happy with my choice. I haven't lost any interest in the medical field. We then researched about software, and hardware, that already exist in our fields. That was Part A. After that, we brainstromed possible future inventions that could exist in our fields. We learned web design skills and basic fundamentals for us to. build this website at the end.

        The tool that I chose was Jekyll and I chose it over the others for several reasons. One of the reasons I chose it was that I wanted to challenge myself even more so that's why I chose to pick from one of the hard tools there was. As a reflection, I do think this was more of a challenge than the other tool since I haven't seen my friends struggle as much as I had with this tool. I do not regret choosing this tool; in fact I'm happy that I learned Jekyll as it seems very efficent and effective. I see myself using this tool again in the future.

        The skills that I have developed (improved) during this time period was a growth mindset and how to read. I have started to ask for help whenever I'm very confused and have tried everything I can to solve a problem. I’m also starting to become patient with myself for not getting the code results I’m expecting. I also realized that mistakes in coding are very good because it forces you to search things online ad seek for help. Most of the time, you will make more mistakes after searching things up which can be fustrating. It's important to remember that fustration is part of learning and that once you learn from your mistake, it is <strong>VERY UNLIKELY</strong> to do the same problem.
