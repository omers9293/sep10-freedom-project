# Future
#### App dedicated to medicine that asks you questions about symptoms you are feeling and is able to prescribe you a pill to get from a nearby pharmacy instead of visiting a doctor/ hospital
* The app needs to be accessible on all types of devices and not just ios/Android
    * This is to help everyone in need of the app regardless of the type of phone they use. A lot of people don’t use ios or android and would be left out if this didn’t happen

* The app needs to contain information about all of the pills and what they are used for
    * This is to accurately assign pills to people around the world. If it didn’t have knowledge about all the pills then it would not be effective
* The app needs to be well function and monitored well by humans as well
    * Chaos may occur if this app is not monitored by humans
* The app will ask relevant questions before prescribing a pill
* The app will give a disclaimer to avoid lawsuits
    * This is a serious topic with health-related ideas. The disclaimer must be given to avoid any trouble

* The app will need information about consumers like past pills used, pills being used today, etc. Ask for past family information
* Developers will continue to stay in touch with consumers to make sure the right pill is being assigned
* The app will provide a text feature where consumers can talk to actual doctors
    * This is due to consumers needing comfort

* To test credibility, developers will first test the app and see if the correct pills are being assigned
    * Developers will test it by pretending they need a certain pill and will fill all the information being asked and will test if it is correct or not
